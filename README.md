Doubly_Stochastic_Gradients
===========================

Code for doubly stochastic gradients

This repository contains two implementations of Doubly Stochastic
Gradients for large-scale kernel methods [1].

The first one is Matlab code on MNIST 8M dataset.

The second one is a GPU implementation based on the cuda-convnet package [2].
